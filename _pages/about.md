Hiiiiiii! Welcome to my page! :D

I'm a sophomore student from [School of Economics and Management](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/index.htm). My major is [Xuetang Class of Economics](https://ug.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/bkjbkxm/jjxxtb.htm), which is aimed at training the best economists. Fortunately, I get instructed by the most famous economist, [Pro. Yinyi Qian](https://www.sem.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1206/31907.htm), and I do want to do some excellent works in economy. Besides that, I also have great interests in Maths, Physics, Politics and Chinese Literature. Now I am also studying a minor degree of Physics in Tsinghua. Learning physics is really attractive to me! I like reading and writing too, and you can view my works on this website.

You can find my CV here: [My Curriculum Vitae](<../assets/CV Yexuan Li.pdf>).

Also, welcome to [My Bilibili Homepage](https://space.bilibili.com/1122146233?spm_id_from=333.33.0.0)! Here you can see my blogs and class videos, and I have also uploaded some course reviewing notes. Of course, more complete course materials can be found on the website.

Now I am not assigned an office in UCB, but I like to study in Long Business Library.

You can contact me through: [Email](liyexuan23@mails.tsinghua.edu.cn) / [Wechat](../images/Wechat.jpg) / [Phone Number](+86-13961583379).

My research interest
======
Recently I have great interest in microeconomics, especially rational behaviours and voting networks. I can show you some of the topics:

- How resourse transformation affects coalition and competition on networks?
- Can decentralization make social welfare better?
- Some specific problems in consumer behaviour, like irrationality and procrastination.

And I also have some ideas in topics below:

- Political economy: How to define and create a good and suitable institution in a country?
- Econphysics: Can we describe human's behaviour in a statistic physics model?
- AI and LLM: How can LLM modify human's behaviour, like writing poems?

If you want to see more details, please see my [Recent Works](https://leeody.github.io/recentworks/).

My hobbies
======
I like reading, watching films (war and history films and comedy), playing games (Kards, Heart of Iron IV and Waorld of Warships, now you know why I like strategies! :P) and writing poems or novels (but I was too busy to start!üò¢).

These days I find Japanese Karuta cards an extremely cool and fun game! But 100 Wakas are really difficult for me to remember. I just watch an Anime named [Chihayafuru](https://www.bilibili.com/bangumi/play/ep11240?spm_id_from=333.337.0.0&from_spmid=666.25.episode.0) about that. And based on that, I want to create a similar game using *Three Hundred Tang Poems*. If you also want to have a try, please tell me!


<!--
My recent research interests are mainly about 
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header. 

Create content & metadata
------
For site content, there is one Markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a Markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each Markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

The repository includes [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual Markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the Markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.
